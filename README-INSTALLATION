Installing CUDD:

	> make install

INSTALLATION NOTE for CUDD:

If you retrieved the code via git, then the file dates will be
incorrect.  This can lead to problems with autoconfiguration, and
possibly cause the make command to fail.  The quick work around is to
execute the command:

	 touch Makefile.am Makefile.in aclocal.m4

before executing the make command.
